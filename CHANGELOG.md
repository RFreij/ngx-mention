# Changelog

## 1.1.0 - 2020-12-18
> :exclamation: **Deprecations have been added in this version**
* Implemented formatSelected configuration callback.
This makes the customTemplate.label obsolete. The whole type of customTemplate will probably change to TemplateRef in v2.

You will be notified during development of this deprecation by console warning, and only when you are using a custom template with a label defined.
The warning is turned off in production
